# Airdrop

This project involves the deployment of an airdrop smart contract for MTK tokens.

Functionalities: airdrop, pause/unpause airdrop, whitelist addresses and amounts for airdrop.

The whitelisting is done by using a merkle tree structure.

The test can be run with npx hardhat test


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
